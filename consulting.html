    <b>I have provided external consulting for the following companies:</b>
    </br></br>
    <b>Bechtel Corporation</b>
</br>Lean Six Sigma consultant
</br>August 2013 - December 2013
<p>Bechtel maintains an error coding system, which assigns a code to problems and solutions that occur during their engineering and construction projects, in order to systematically categorize and track issues.
    
    My four other teammates and I built metrics to collect and measure data, performed advanced statiscal analyses to identify accuracy of the error coding system, devised a solution to correct the problem, and summarized our recommendations in our deliverables to the senior process improvement team at Bechtel.
</p>

    <b>GE Aviation</b>
</br>Lean Manufacturing consultant
</br>September 2012 – January 2013
<p>Middle River Aircraft Systems is building a new large-scale aircraft factory in Mississippi. I have collaborated with a group of consultants to develop a floor layout that would allow the factory meet its target production rate. The development process includes capacity analysis of work cells in rooms, understanding of manufacturing processes and restrictions, as well as cell manufacturing, and consideration of possible environment, health, and safety issues.

    This process involves understanding of cell manufacturing, process flow, each of the involved processes, and EHS concerns.</p>
<p>
    Our new floor layout increased the jet engine factory's production capacity by <b>32%.</b>
