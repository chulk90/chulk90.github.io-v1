    <b>GE Aviation</b>
</br>September 2012 – Present
<p>Middle River Aircraft Systems is building a new large-scale aircraft factory in Mississippi. I have collaborated with a group of consultants to develop a floor layout that would allow the factory meet its target production rate. The development process includes capacity analysis of work cells in rooms, understanding of manufacturing processes and restrictions, as well as cell manufacturing, and consideration of possible environment, health, and safety issues.

    This process involves understanding of cell manufacturing, process flow, each of the involved processes, and EHS concerns.</p>
<p>
    Our new floor layout increased the jet engine factory's production capacity by <b>32%.</b>
